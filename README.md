## User Story Testing

1. As a **site-owner** I want **users to be able to navigate my site** so that **they can find information**

- Our website has all the information nicely organised in the correct areas with a clear navigation bar across the top of all pages in the website. The navigation bar has all the links correctly connected so that users can easily find the information they need. 

![Nav Bar](https://github.com/Libbu/CyberPixels/blob/main/media/navbar.png)

2. As a **user** I would like **to see high quality pictures of destinations** so I can decide if I want to go there.

- On our website there are multiple high quality images of the destinations that capture the beauty of each location. Image captions describing the locations pictured have not been added but can be later.

![Showcase](https://github.com/Libbu/CyberPixels/blob/main/media/showcasesection.png)

3. As a **site owner** I want **users to be able to enquire about the tour** so that I can **convert them to customers**

- Our website has an Enquiries page where users can sign up and enquire about the tour. The page includes a form that users can fill in to sign up and get the information they need to decide if they'll be going on the tour.

![form](https://github.com/Libbu/CyberPixels/blob/main/media/formactual.JPG)

4. As a **user who relies on a screen reader** I want **the images and icons on the website to have meaningful alt text** so that I can **use the site.**

- Users who rely on screen readers will easily be able to tell what is happening on the website as we've implemented meaningful alt text on all images, icons and form fields. 


5. As a **user** I want to **see written information about different travel destinations** so that I can decide if I want to go there.

- Our website is designed to make it easy for users to find the written information they'd like with a clear navigation bar at the top of the page and links to sections pertaining to the relevant destination on the homepage. The text is clear, can easily be read and gives relevant information about the destination such as why you should go there and what there is for you to do.

![Destinations Information](https://github.com/Libbu/CyberPixels/blob/main/media/dest2.png)

6. As a **site owner** I **want a meaningful homepage** so that **users know what is available on the site.** 

- We have created a beautiful homepage that clearly lets the user know the purpose, it features high quality images of the destinations, has relevant information and is easily navigated. 

![Home Page](https://github.com/Libbu/CyberPixels/blob/main/media/homepagereadme.JPG)

7. As a **user** I want **the option to sign up to a mailing list** so that I can **know about any deals and offers available**

- On the Enquiries page of the website right above the submit button there's an unchecked checkbox for users to opt into receiving promotions of the latest deals and offers that is optimised for the best user experience.

![mailling list](https://github.com/Libbu/CyberPixels/blob/main/media/mail.JPG)

8. As a **site owner** I want **my webpage to look good on all devices** so that users can **access it in different ways.**

- Our website is accessable and responsive on different devices and browsers. It changes the layout for the best possible user experience no matter the device used. 

9. As a **user** I want  **to see social media links** so that I can **follow them on different platforms.**

- The website has a clear footer throughout, with all the links to social media in a clear format so that users are able to follow on whichever platform they choose. The links open up on a seperate tab so users can easily find their way back to where they were. 

![Footer](https://github.com/Libbu/CyberPixels/blob/main/media/footer.png)

10. As a **user** I want **to see reviews from people who have been on the tour** so that I can **decide if I would like to go.** 

- Unfortunately, due to where it fell in prioritisation we were unable to implement this feature. However, it can easily be implemented in future revisions due to our easy-to-edit code layout. 

### Features For Future Implementation

- A section for reviews from people who have used our website to plan their journey in these areas.
- Captions on all images so that users know where they were taken.
- Users receiving feedback when the enquiries form is submitted.
- An affiliate section for reputable accomodation or attraction providers we are either connected to or have good relationships with.
- A "comming soon" section where we can highlight upcoming countires or regions of focus.
